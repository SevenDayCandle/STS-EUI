# Adding Translations

1. Create a folder under the src/main/resources/localization/extendedui folder. This name must be named with the three-letter abbreviation used by Slay the Spire to denote your language
2. Duplicate all the files under src/main/resources/localization/extendedui/eng into your new folder
3. Make any changes to these files as needed. For special text formatting (e.g. pluralization), please refer to https://github.com/SevenDayCandle/STS-CompendiumFilters/wiki/Smart-Text-Rendering
4. When your change is ready, submit a pull request with all of your new files
